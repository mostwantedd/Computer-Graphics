# Computer-Graphics
The aim of the project was to create a rendering program in C++. The program is able to generate a rasterised wireframe image of any model given only a .ply file, compute the depth map of any model, perform shading, illuminate any scene using photon mapping with integrated BRDF that also supports reflection and refraction effects.
